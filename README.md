Setting Up

First take a screenshot of the first question of the section that you are doing. Then make it full screen on the screen that you will be using. (You will need to re do this each time you do a diffrent thing of it, such as one config for stickers and another one for 100 club check)

Open the calabrate.py and on line 5 change the file name to what you want

Copy the whole line and replace line 6 in the mainProgram.py

Run the calabrate.py file and hover the mouse over over where it tells you too (over the screenshot)

Then run the main program and press s whenever you want the program to complete the calculation. Make sure you have the sparks maths calibrated the same, and set up before you begin to run the code.
